This is a Streamlit-based Health Management App integrated with Google Gemini Pro Vision API. The app allows users to upload an image containing food items and input a prompt related to nutrition. The app then utilizes Google's Gemini Pro Vision AI model to analyze the image and generate a response based on the input prompt.

The main functionality of the app revolves around calculating the total calories of the food items in the uploaded image and providing details of each food item's calorie intake. Additionally, the app aims to determine whether the food is healthy or not and provide a breakdown of the percentage split of important nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, fibers, sugar, and other essential components required in our diet.

The user interface of the app includes:

An input field for the user to enter a prompt related to nutrition.
A file uploader to allow users to upload an image containing food items.
Display of the uploaded image for reference.
A button to trigger the calculation of total calories and nutrient breakdown.
Presentation of the response generated by the Gemini Pro Vision AI model, including details of food items, their calorie intake, and nutritional information.
Overall, this Health Management App aims to provide users with insights into the nutritional content of the food items captured in images, helping them make informed decisions about their diet and health.
